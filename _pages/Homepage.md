Education Background
======
* 2009-2013, Peking University, Bachelor of Science
* 2013-2018, Peking University, Doctor of Science
* 2018-2020, Peking University, Postdoc (Mathematics)
* 2016-2017, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Visiting Scholar
* 2020-Present，China Agricultural University, Associate Professor

Research Overview
======
* I have published over 40 scholarly articles across the disciplines of spatio-temporal big data and geographic information systems, including more than 10 SCI papers as the first author or corresponding author. I have actively participated in the formulation of 2 national standards and 3 IEEE international standards. Additionally, I have hosted two national-level scientific research projects, including one funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, alongside numerous horizontal projects. Furthermore, I have organized and chaired multiple sessions, as well as delivered oral reports, at international conferences such as the International Conference on Smart Agriculture Innovative Development, ACM Sigspatial, IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, and the International Geographical Congress.

* As a member of the Key Laboratory of Agricultural Big Data, I concentrate on resolving fundamental, cutting-edge, comprehensive, and key scientific and technological challenges in the field of agricultural machinery operation monitoring and big data applications in China. My primary goal is to establish a national ecosystem for intelligent sensing, dynamic monitoring, and data application services in agricultural machinery operations, thereby providing technical support for agricultural machinery production management and agricultural policy formulation.Significant endeavors like the Wheat Harvest News of our laboratory have garnered widespread attention within the industry and received encouraging directives from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. During the Three Summers initiative (The Three Summer refer to the critical agricultural period in China, encompassing summer harvest, planting, and crop management, ensuring a smooth transition between crop cycles and maintaining agricultural productivity), our relevant findings were daily updated in the Three Summers in Progress  section on the official website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Furthermore, these achievements have been featured in various official media outlets, including CCTV's Nightly News，Xinhua News Agency, Science and Technology Daily, Farmers' Daily, and others.
