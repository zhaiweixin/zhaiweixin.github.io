permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'In the application of geographic data inquiry, traditional search engine put up with queries using keyword matching method mostly, which, however, can hardly get the most accurate and expected answers for users, because spatial semantic queries described by human natural language are difficult for computers to understand. To solve this problem, a method of semantic translation in geographic space using global subdivision grid is put forward in this paper. By summing up the geographic spatial semantic expressing pattern, extracting spatial keywords from searching sentence, finally establish the relationship between spatial semantic meaning and spatial data results.Experiments are also designed and implemented, which results show that method in this paper could accomplish the geographic spatial semantic translation with fair accuracy.'
