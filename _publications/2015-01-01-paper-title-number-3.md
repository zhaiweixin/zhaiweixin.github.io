permalink: /publication/2015-01-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'Currently the UAV photographic data is unstable, 
turbulent and inaccurate, and these flaws make image 
stitching difficult. This paper proposed an innovative fast
method based on global subdivision GeoSOT grid frame. 
And this method can apply to the high-speed image 
stitching of a certain area at different times on the UAV. 
The experiment result shows the advantages of the new 
method over the traditional one.'
