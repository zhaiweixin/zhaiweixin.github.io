Abstract : This documents put forward an advanced method to manage the rapid increasing spatial data. The core idea of the proposed method is the application of GeoSOT grid. In this geo-information management system, all the spatial data are marked by one or more codes for identification and the mentioned code is simply related to the geographical attributes regardless of the other characteristics. Further, we pay attention to the agricultural service applications and the dwelling service applications, and it turned out that our management method demonstrates the advantages of the traditional methods. Because of the high efficiency and convenience of this method, its application scenario is supposed to be quite broad in the future.
