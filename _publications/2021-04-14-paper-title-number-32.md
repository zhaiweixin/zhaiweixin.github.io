Abstract : With an increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the difficulty of UAV management becomes more challenging, especially for low-altitude airspace due to complicated issues of security, privacy and flexibility. Existing management approaches to UAV flights include implementing registration of flight activity for supervision purposes, limiting the maximum flight height, setting different zones for different flight activities and prohibiting flights.In this research, we proposed a new air traffic management method for UAVs based on global subdivision theory. We designed four types of low-altitude air routes from grids, which correspond to grid sizes of 1.85 km, 128 m, 64 m and 32 m. Utilization of the subdivision grids transforms the complex spatial computation problem into a query process in the spatial database, which provides a new approach to UAV management in the fifth-generation (5G) era. We compared the number and data size of stored track records using longitude and latitude and different grid levels, computed time consumption for air route trafficability and simulated UAV flight to verify the feasibility of constructing this type of air traffic highway system. The amount of data storage and time consumption for air route trafficability can be substantially reduced by subdivision. For example, the data size using traditional expressions of latitude and longitude is approximately 1.5 times that of using a 21-level grid, and the time consumption by coordinates is approximately 1.5 times that of subdivision grids at level 21. The results of the simulated experiments indicate that in the 5G environment,gridded airspace can effectively improve the efficiency of UAV trajectory planning and reduce the size of information storage in the airspace environment. Therefore, given the increasing number of UAVs in the future, gridded highways have the potential to provide a foundation for various UAV applications.
