Abstract : Agricultural machinery operations are mainly performed by cross-regional socialized services in China. It is necessary to take advantage of national data system to implement dynamic monitoring, data sharing, and big data applications for agricultural machinery operations. This application note outlines the system composition, principal technology, primary functions, and application examples of the big data system. This system integrates agricultural machinery operations with big data, which can promote scientific decision-making with data management and facilitate more efficient agricultural production. Promoting the effective, orderly, and scientific growth of agricultural machinery operations and the advancement of agricultural modernization is of theoretical and practical importance.
